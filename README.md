## A powershell "emulator" made in Next.js and Tailwind CSS

While this was supposed to be only for my eyes, I figured I'd rather help someone out if they wanted to look at how it's done (terribly) and see what not to do. 

This is my first real React project and I doubt the practices used are novel or helpful in any way, but I couldn't find any examples online for what I was trying to accomplish.

Commands are located in /src/app/input-handle.js

Expect comments made only for my eyes to be visible all throughout the codebase of this project, sorry in advance.

## Serve

run `npm run dev`
